#What prints out is the whole dictionary. It also prints out dog twice being that it asks to find the word dog twice.
#It then asks for a true or false statement for if the word cat is in the dictionary as well as the word monkey.
#What happens with the kitten code is that it gives you an error message because the word kitten isn't within your dictionary.
